# PROJECT_LOG.md — Rebalancify Implementation History

## AGENT CONTEXT

**What this file is:** A living implementation history log — one entry per completed story. Agents scan the last 3–5 entries at the start of every session to understand recent decisions, discovered issues, and carry-over notes.
**Derived from:** BMAD-inspired project logging practice
**Connected to:** PROGRESS.md (status tracker), CLAUDE.md (master rules), all STORY-*.md files
**Critical rules for agents using this file:**
- Add a new entry at the TOP of the Completed Stories section every time a story is marked complete.
- Never edit past entries — they are append-only history.
- Keep each entry concise: ~10–15 lines. Expand only if there is a critical discovery.
- Scan the last 3–5 entries before starting any new story.

## Entry Template

**What was built:**
- [Bullet: key file or feature delivered]
- [Bullet: key file or feature delivered]

**Decisions made:**
- [Decision + reason — e.g., "Used X instead of Y because Z"]

**Discovered issues / carry-over notes:**
- [Issue or note that future stories must know — e.g., "Supabase free tier does not support X; workaround in lib/Y.ts"]

**Quality gates passed:** type-check ✅ | test ✅ | build ✅ | RLS ✅
